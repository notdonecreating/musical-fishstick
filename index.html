  <h1>Welcome to Yaptitude</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>You ever imagine the lives that you miss, <br>
    by not reaching out, held back by the risk, <br>
    not connecting, or expressing, the way that you like? <br>
    maybe Yaptitude can help with getting that right!</p>

    <p>Social skills aren’t innate, they’re always built! <br>
    But practice, not theory, gives you the skill, <br>
    Yet many still fear rehearsal mistakes, <br>
    could paint them in ways they’d struggle to shake.</p>

    <p>With Yaptitude practice, you can test and refine, <br>
    The guides and drills, no crossed lines with AI. <br>
    You’ll build real-life skills and become someone bold, <br>
    Then go out in the world, where impressions will hold.</p>

    <p>Speak with ease, to anyone, anywhere, <br>
    No preparation needed, no weight to bear. <br>
    Tell stories that captivate, speeches that soar, <br>
    Turn rambling thoughts to something adored.</p>

    <p>Connect with others, and make them feel heard, <br>
    Be wittier, funnier, and flirt with the world, <br>
    Bring energy, spark, and a smile that can’t lose, <br>
    And radiate aliveness whenever you choose.</p>

    <p>With Yaptitude, you’re guided, one drill at a time, <br>
    To become the you you’ve yet to define. <br>
    Unlock the whole world, where chances await, <br>
    Let Yaptitude grant you a key to your fate!</p>
